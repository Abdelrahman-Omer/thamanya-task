### Gson ProGuard and R8 rules which are relevant for all users
### This file is automatically recognized by ProGuard and R8, see https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#configuration-files
###
### IMPORTANT:
### - These rules are additive; don't include anything here which is not specific to Gson (such as completely
###   disabling obfuscation for all classes); the user would be unable to disable that then
### - These rules are not complete; users will most likely have to add additional rules for their specific
###   classes, for example to disable obfuscation for certain fields or to keep no-args constructors
###

# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
-keepattributes Signature

# Keep Gson annotations
# Note: Cannot perform finer selection here to only cover Gson annotations, see also https://stackoverflow.com/q/47515093
-keepattributes RuntimeVisibleAnnotations,AnnotationDefault

### The following rules are needed for R8 in "full mode" which only adheres to `-keepattribtues` if
### the corresponding class or field is matches by a `-keep` rule as well, see
### https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#r8-full-mode

# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature) if present
-if class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-keep,allowobfuscation class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken

# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
-keep,allowobfuscation class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken

# Keep classes with @JsonAdapter annotation
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowoptimization @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter class *

# Keep fields with any other Gson annotation
# Also allow obfuscation, assuming that users will additionally use @SerializedName or
# other means to preserve the field names

  @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter <fields>;
